Moving to NixOS

Highly technical, Linux, Opinion

Disclaimer
----------

This post will be rather more technical compared to what I
normally write about. I will be using a lot of technical jargon
specific to the Linux desktop space. If you are not familiar
with this world, then I suggest you skip this post, there are
more coming soon (tm).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I recently migrated my (main and only) system from Alpine Linux
to NixOS. In this post I will explain why I made the switch and
why I consider Nix to be -- currently -- the best Linux
distribution available.

Nix is a project that has been on my radar of quite some time
now. It is a system designed around the principles of
reproducibility, build-isolation, and declarative design, while
also boasting one of the largest and most up-to-date software
repositories in the Linux world.

Of course, there is a lot of hype around Nix, and this tends to
be a dangerous thing. In fact, I switched away from Arch Linux a
few years ago exactly because it was increasingly flooded with
novice users drawn in by the hype who considered the forums
their personal large-language-model[1]. Aside from the hype
though, there were a number of aspects which seemed really
attractive to me. Rollbacks, Software availability, and
Reproducibility being the main ones. On their own, these were
not enough to overcome the cost of switching, that is until I
encountered some problems with my existing Alpine installation.

Alpine
------

When I initially switched from Arch to Alpine, I was very
pleased for various reasons. The Alpine Package Keeper (apk) is
-- to this day -- the most pleasant, fast, and reliable package
manager I have used, Alpine's bi-yearly stable releases allowed
me to have a more stable system, and the installer that came
with my flavour of Alpine (PostmarketOS) allowed me to recover
from catastrophic breakages faster than with Arch.

Out of these benefits, stability and recoverability were the
most important ones. These values are important for two main
reasons.  Firstly, I only have one laptop at my disposal, and it
is an arm laptop at that. If my OS breaks in some catastrophic
manner, I will need to borrow someone else's laptop, take out
the EMMC storage, and re-flash the operating system. A process
that could take several days if none of my friends' laptops are
available. Faster installations (that can be done from windows
or mac) massively increase the chances that I will be able to
recover my system in a reasonable amount of time. Secondly, I do
not generally have a lot of time to tinker with my system
outside of holidays. For this reason, I have gotten in the
habit of only running updates every half year or so. If I would
do this on Arch, everything would rather quickly break, and I
would likely not be able to install anything in-between because
there would be a dependency mismatch.

In other words: Alpine stable is perfect for me. There is one
problem however: I can't use it. `Can't' is a big word of
course, and I must admit that I could theoretically live with a
stable alpine release. But as it stands, I use a lot of software
from Alpine's `testing' repository, which requires one to be on
Alpine Linux `edge', the rolling-release side of Alpine. In
other words, almost the entire previous paragraph can be thrown
out. I will say that Alpine's apk handles infrequent updates
better than Arch's pacman, but it still is not ideal that I need
to be `edge' at all.. 

This leads us to today: the start of the winter holidays. I
tried running an update and it did not go well. Firstly, apk
updates itself, so far so good. Secondly it tried to instal
`mesa-asahi' for some reason. I have still not figured out which
program introduced this new dependency. For those who do not
know `mesa-asahi' is the graphics driver for Apple's arm-based
macs which recently landed in alpine-testing. I do not have an
arm-based mac, and so I don't know why this should have been
installed. The reasons are however meaningless because
`mesa-asahi' introduced a conflict with `mesa' generally (the
graphics drivers I actually need) because the former was already
on version 24.3 while the rest was still on 24.2.

I tried running `apk fix' which is generally a good idea when
you encounter a conflict with apk. This command (for some
reason) updated `qt6' and nothing else. This meant that any app
using qt6, like my web browser, document viewer, file manager,
music player, video player, tormenting client, and others, would
not work until they-too were updated.

Since I didn't think I needed mesa-asahi in the first place (I
never installed it up to that point, and I didn't see why I
should start now), I decided to simply tell apk to exclude the
package and update as usual. This seemed to have... weird
effects. Firstly, none of my graphical programs were working
anymore. GTK applications gave some sort or error which I cannot
at the moment recall while QT applications just segfaulted -- a
great start. Secondly, the system was incredibly slow: both in
being sluggish to use and taking three times longer to boot than
usual.

Now -- clearly -- I messed something up by telling apk not to
include mesa-asahi in the update. Indeed these problems may be
attributable to missing graphics drivers -- with the system
falling back to software rendering. However, the dependency
introduction and version-mismatch were both out of my control,
and the fact that `apk fix' updated QT6 and broke all my
graphical applications meant that I couldn't just wait for the
version conflict to be resolved[2].

I though for some time about what to do -- re-installing
Alpine-edge might work, or I could try Alpine-stable and make-do
without half of my software -- and ultimately decided that I
could not stay on Alpine due to the simultaneous need to be on
`edge' while also needing a rock-solid system. Which brings us
to Nix.

NixOS
-----

I managed to download the NixOS installer ISO with `curl' and
install it to a borrowed USB-stick using `dd' while still on my
broken Alpine install. According to the wiki, I should just be
able to use the graphical installer on my system. Easy peasy.

This was not the case. The graphical installer does not have a
menu to select the bootloader, and nix's default loader `grub'
does not work well on arm based systems. Luckily the wiki-page
for installing NixOS on arm single-board-computers had the
correct instructions for a manual install, and a few minutes
later I had a fresh install of NixOS.

My initial impressions of Nix were rather positive. It was
remarkably easy to learn, and there were a lot of resources
available, notably the wiki and the forums. At first I had some
trouble to get things working properly. Every time I ran an
update, the updater itself would be broken on the new
install[3]. Everytime though, I could just roll-back to the
previous version and try again[4].

I spent some time getting my usual configuration set up using
nix and noticed just how helpful the nix-rebuild command was.
For instance, when I tried to install flatpak, nix informed me
that for flatpak to be functional, I needed to enable the
xdg-desktop-portal service. After doing this, it told me that I
didn't have an actual portal configured and/or installed. For
context. If you do this on Arch or Alpine, you are pretty much
left to your own devices in figuring out how to get these
working, especially if you are not using a pre-configured
desktop environment.

A second immediately noticeable difference was the sheer size of
the nix repositories. Every piece of software which I use, with
the exception of one[5], was in the nix repositories, and I use
a lot of niche and obscure software. The only somewhat strange
thing I noticed is that the font which I like to use for my
desktop: droid, was not in the stable repository, but only the
unstable one[6]. This didn't matter though as nix allows me to
add just this one package from the unstable repository while
keeping my others on version 24.11.

Nix handily beats Alpine in terms of software availability. I
think this is in large-part to to the fact that alpine requries
more porting work due to its use of musl-libc and openrc, rather
than the more standard glibc and systemd Nix also beats Arch if
you look only at the main repositories. The arch user repository
still has an edge over nix in some cases, but this is not so
much as repository as much as it is a collection of build scripts
which -- in my experience -- work about as often as they do not.

Lastly is recoverability. I already mentioned nix's rollback
feature, but even if my laptop dies in its entirety, if the
drive gets corrupted, or if I want to move to a different
system, I will be able to get back on track in no time
whatsoever. This is because an entire NixOS install is
essentially defined as a configuration file. I have this
configuration backed up in a public Github repository[7] and can
therefore recover my system in minutes, rather than hours or
days.

All in all I am loving nix so far, and I will probably keep
using it for quite some time.

[1]: As a quick aside, I think the classic Arch-user-forum
     response `RTFM' (Read the F Manual), is harmful to the
     community as a whole, though I cannot deny that most of the
     questions raised by new uses are described extensively on
     the excellent wiki pages.
[2]: As of writing, the mesa package has still not been updated
     and the version conflict persists. It has been about a
     week.
[3]: This is 100% a case of user-error, and not a problem with
     Nix or NixOS.
[4]: I recall when I first installed Arch constantly messing
     things up and re-installing from scratch. Even on Alpine I
     once managed to remove any means of connecting to wifi and
     needing to re-install.
[5]: I can't even blame nix for this. The program in question is
     a niche add-on to a niche program which has not been updated
     in over a year. The only reason this program is in the
     Alpine repositories is because I added it there.
[6]: I don't know exactly what it means for a typeface
     to be `unstable', but I believe it has something to do with
     the fact that droid is designed for small-screen-interfaces which
     are currently under heavy development.
