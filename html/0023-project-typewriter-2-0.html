Project Typewriter 2.0

=======================

I have, for some time now, been interested in developing some
sort of machine which is only capable of writing. Those who have
read my the previous iterations of this blog may remember the
typewriter which onto which I wired a USB output. The typewriter
itself is also such a system, one which allows me to record my
tough's onto paper without the possibility for further
distractions. Today, I have developed a new system. It is by-far
the most usable one, which I am proving by writing this very post
on it (excuse the above-average amount of typos).

Before getting into how exactly this system works, let me outline
what it needs to be capable of doing. Any system on which I write
must of course have an input method as well as some sort of
feedback to the user. A screen, a piece of paper, potentially
even sound. Secondly, the system must be able to store the
written files in some digital manner. Lastly, I want to keep the
system as minimal as possible, preferably being able to run it
off a battery ban. It goes without saying that the system also
needs to be accurate and fast enough to keep up with my
(admittedly modest) typing speed.

Having outlined the requirements, let us get in to the latest
addition to my typing repertoire. This post is currently being
written on a raspberry pi 400 with a 2*16 LCD character display
attached. The raspberry pi 400, for those who do not know, is a
small fanless computer built entirely inside of a keyboard. I
will not go over all the specifications regarding the raspberry
pi, but what is important to note is how you can use the device
to driver various electronics The pi has access to 40 GPIO pins
which can be connected to motors, sensors, lights, etcetera,
which can then be controlled by software.

In this case, the object connected to the pi is an LCD character
display, which is capable of displaying a total of 30 characters
in beautiful black-on-green text. The display is driven by a
small python script which is indeed so simple, that calling it a
text-editor probably counts as a direct insult for anyone who has
ever actually worked on one. The script is divided into two parts
which operate independently of one another. This asynchronous
nature of the script is perhaps its most complicated feature,
which says a lot about how minimalist its feature set is. The
first part simple listens for key presses and stores the keys in
memory. If the backspace is pressed, the latest character is
removed from memory. When the return key is pressed, the current
line is saved to a file, at which point the program will proceed
to forget about it.

The second part of the program updates the display. The display
is rather slow and the driver will by-default wait for the
display to finish drawing before continuing with the script. This
is exactly why this part must be handled separately from the key
recording. If these were handled on the same thread, then
keystones would not be registered while the display was updating.
The display code therefore simply looks at the current working
string, formats it to fit on the 2*16 display, and sends it off
to the drawn.

That is really the extent of the editor. I added in a slight
quality-of-life addition in the ability to exit the program by
simply writing EXIT on an empty line. After doing so, a new file
will be created (its name determined by the date and time), and
the user's input will now be written onto that file instead.

Obviously, these files must be taken off the internal SD card of
the pi and put onto an actual computer for editing and
publishing. Alternatively, you can attach a full monitor to the
pi itself and do all the work from there. It is after all a fully
functioning computer running Linux. This current iteration of my
``typewriter project'' will probably be the host of a number of
other blog posts. Writing on it gives a fun atmosphere, and the
entire setup is light, power efficient, and even usable in bright
daylight (unlike laptops or tablets). Unlike the actual
typewriter which I gave a usb port; this version actually
registers keystrokes consistently, is carry able with without a
briefcase, requires neither ink nor paper, and is not loud enough
to keep everybody in a 100 meter radius awake. I will miss the
typewriter somewhat, though with the improvements OCR is making
these days, I suppose I could just use it without the USB port.

Code as always is available on my GitHub [1], though keep in mind
that this is largely untested, unoptimized, and uncommented code.
If you have interest in building a system like this yourself
though, feel free to send me an email at blog@wester.digital.
