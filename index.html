Welcome, to the Wester.Digital plaintext blog where I post poorly
written content on whatever happens to currently interest me. At
the moment, this includes: technology, philosophy, academia, and
life generally.

All of my writings are available as through the web, gopher and
rss:

It feels strange to not have my automatic footer here. So let me
just say: if you value my work, I encourage you to donate to a
charity of your choosing, I personally like ActionAid and
MossyEarth (not a charity).
