The return of the blog
</title><pubDate>Tue, 5 Dec 2023</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<pre>
Meta content
=========================

Hi, it has been a while hasn't it?

For the uninitiated: I used to run a regular html/css blog on my personal home
server. This `server' was in fact just a raspberry pi stuffed in a shoebox which
lived underneath my parents' ISP-provided modem/router. I always knew that this
system would fail some day, and living more than one thousand kilometers away, I
would have no way of fixing things. This happened way back in May of 2023. I
fixed the issue on a visit this summer, only for the SD-card to break itself
again not a month later. All this time, I have add the itch to write, but there
were two problems: First, my server was fried, and second, my static site
generator was on that sever.

Yes you heard that right, I was a total [REDACTED] and kept the only version of
my software on a device prone to breaking. I suffered and I learned. My old
static site generator was an incredibly efficient Makefile, consisting of less
than 50 lines of code. Despite its brevity, it handled: indexing, rss, styling,
special pages, and more. Re-writing this system has been the main holdup for me
in terms of writing.

Now, I hear you thinking: `it was only 50 lines of code, it could not take more
than an afternoon to reproduce'. This is entirely true, however there is one
other little snag: my laptop gave up life. For the record: I know what is wrong,
and I know how to fix it, but the process is rather too-involved for my current
schedule. As such, I have been reduced to my mobile, and the ipad I
historically only used for annotating pdf's, and dealing with modern society (in
the form of banking apps, identification, loyalty cards, etcetera).

As you may know: ipads are not exactly great for programming. Granted, there are
some really impressive apps out there such as ish which emulates a full x86
alpine environment, and a-shell which aims to bring a unix environment to the
ipad (this is actually what I am writing this post on). These apps are
incredibly impressive, and a-shell is the sole reason I can even afford to leave
my laptop unimpaired for now. Nevertheless, the programmings-side-of-things is
currently too clunky, making a re-write of the static site generator a much
greater effort than it should be (For context, currently in a-shell, there is no
way to loop over a file in it's port of dash...).

All of this nasty weather comes with a massive silver lining though: not having
access to my usual way of doing things has exposed me to many new systems which I
wish to write about. That, and the fact that I have about one year worth of
posts to catch up on should make for an interesting year.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With all of that preamble out of the way, let's talk about the new blogging
system. It is INCREDIBLY simple, and very scuffed, but I must say, I find it has
a certain charm to it. Basically, I have a folder containing plaintext files.
The first line is a title, the second the date, and the third the tags (though
not even this is fixed, these three lines can contain whatever). These files are
pushed to a GitHub repository where a small script is ran on them. I cannot
stress enough: this script is SMALL. All it does is list the files in reverse
chronological order, and grab the first three lines from each using unix head. I
use some sed magic to get urls working in html, but that is it.

    ls -rc posts/* | xargs head -n 3
    # the rest is commentary

I was inspired to do things this way largely from my explorations of
gopherspace. For those who do not know: Gopher is a very simple internet
protocol which was around before the modern web. It essentially serves plaintext
files much like this one, and has some special syntax to deal with links and
such things. Gopher has been largely phased out by the growth of the web, though
-- as with all things --  a bunch of stubborn nerds refuse to let it go. In case
it is not clear: those are terms of affects, and I am such a suborn nerd.

I severely disliked gopher when I first learned of it. I saw no reason to
distribute information over protocols which required specialized software to
retrieve. That is not to say I liked the modern web mind you, but gopher (and
gemmini for that matter) seemed like they would just require yet another
application to exist on my system. This was especially frustrating because I
read only one gopher phlog at the time, and I considered switching to a
different application just for that a waste of time. I also hated that there
were no RSS feeds (which I still consider the only saving grace for the modern
web), thus separating these phlogs even more from my other content. (Just before
anyone asks: yes I will eventually get rss working on this site as well, but
writing is currently more important to me than programming).

All of that is to say: things have changed, and I now spent a significant
portion of my internet time on gopher. I became inspired by gopher phlogs
such as hoi.st by Luxeferre, someone I know from my days working on KaiOS -- and
gopher.black by James Tomasino, to create a very simple site so I could just
focus on getting some of my writing out there again.

I might mirror or migrate this blog to gopher some time in the future. It
certainly seems a lot better suited for that space, but for now: I just want to
write again, and this is the easiest way to do that. Thus we have this weird
https-plaintext, I assure you that it is as confusing to me as it is to you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will fill this blog with some actual content soon, now that it is up again, I
expect I will be writing frequently, we have a lot to catch up on.

My current tech setup
</title><pubDate>Wed, 6 Dec 2023</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<pre>
Technology, Travel
======================

Over the period that this blog has been offline, my tech setup has changed a
lot. The devices I use, the software that runs on them, and the interpretation
of my personal technology guidelines has all changed. What I think is very
interesting to observe in this change is that my background ideas have stayed
consistent, even though there are few similarities observable at first glance
between by tech now and December of last year.

Let me first outline my principles for using technology. Electronics and I have
a love-hate relationship, and we are only staying together for the kids (id est:
because you cannot navigate modern society without electronics). My principles
allow me to use tech in such a way that I not tempted to go full-Unabomber more
than once a month (the live-in-the-woods type, not the letterbomb type). So,
without further ado, here are my principles:

    - The tech I use works for me, I don't work for it
    - Portability is key
    - Environmental concerns trump usability
    - Embrace digital minimalism

Now, I could go over every point in this list and explain exactly what I mean by
it, but I think it is more interesting to display my application of these
principles by looking at my old setup, and by new one. Both of these setups
adhere to the principles, though to varying degrees, and with different
interpretations.

The old setup
-------------

My old setup contained the following devices:
    
    - A non-smart mobile phone (sometimes two)
    - An android tablet
    - A Pinebook pro laptop
        - A USB webcam and Microphone
    - A Lomo instant square polaroid camera
    - A xDuoo 3II media player

There were some other items, such a set of cassette-walkmen (walkmans?), but
those are not remarkably important to cover here. All of the items above filled
a specific niche. The phones were in my pocket so I was reachable at all times
by SMS and call. The android tablet was for reading books and annotating papers.
The laptop was my university machine, meaning that I used it to run vim and
LaTeX, follow online classes, hand in assignments, download study materials, and
stay in touch with colleagues. The Lomo camera was to capture memories of various
trips, hikes, and events. Lastly, the media player was there for my ever present
love of music.

Now to cover the principles. With this setup, I interpreted the first principle
as follows: Use simple software or build your own. If a piece of software worked
against my way of doing things too much, I would modify it, or build a different
system from scratch. During this period, I made various mobile apps for my
Nokias including: weather info, bible reading, sudokus, tertris, Google
authenticator, and other miscellaneous things. I wrote my own set of macros for
the Troff typesetting system. I designed a plaintext to pdf calendar system.
Lastly, I wrote basically an entire desktop environment for Linux, save for the
window manager.

For portability, and environmentalism, a large consideration was battery life.
The Nokias needed to be charged once per week, the xDuoo even less frequently.
The camera ran on two 1.5 v batteries which lasted well over a year, and the
laptop and tablet had such low power draw that I could charge them with my tiny
20w portable solar panel.

The setup was furthermore portable because I could decide exactly what to bring
for every trip, carrying no more or less than I needed. This was also how I
embraced digital minimalism at the time. Even though there were many devices in
my daily rotation, every device was itself minimalistic, aiming to do no more or
less than I required of it.

The new setup
-------------

As I said, my new setup has a very different daily rotation. I now use:

    - A 6th generation iPad mini
    - A 2017 Samsung galaxy A7 smartphone

Quite a shorter list eh? So what happened? When I returned to my home country
over the summer, I met up with my grandparents who expressed a wish to video
call me on occasion, something which was not possible with my devices at the
time (because my grandparents insisted on using WhatsApp). I noted that I would
consider getting an old smartphone for that purpose, though I tried to convince
them to just use signal, zoom, discord, skype, or really anything that was not
WhatsApp (even though I highly dislike all of these platforms). At this point,
my grandfather pulled his `old smartphone' from the shelf. A device which is
still fully capable of performing the tasks a smartphone needs to do. The only
thing that is aged about is is the USB micro-B charging port.

As such, I switched from my two beautiful Nokia flipphones to a one dual-sim-
smartphone. The primary reason I fully switched, rather than just keeping the
Samsung around for video calls, is that I really did not want to add yet another
device to my rotation. The smartphone also came with some other benefits.  Here
in Norway, many, many things work using apps: Loyalty cards, public transport,
banking, library cards, digital identification, two factor authentication,
etcetera. For most of these services therefore, I had specific cards or devices
issues by the bank, government, university, and so forth.  Each of these cards
and devices lived in my wallet, though switching to apps for these things, I
have managed to completely get rid of my wallet, simply carrying a few cards in
my phone case (cash is not a thing in Norway anyways). The smartphone also did
away with the need for a separate media player and camera. Both of these devices
still have their uses, one as a powerful DAC, the other for vacation pictures,
but neither are now part of my daily rotation.

Thus far the story behind the smartphone, but what about the other items? Well,
the android tablet started misbehaving, and it really was not suited anymore for
everyday use. I decided to buy an iPad because -- according to my experience
with them -- they last remarkably long, both in hardware and software. I
furthermore wanted to try out the apple pencil for annotations, and perhaps even
for notetaking during classes, rather than my paper/pen setup from back then.

While shopping for this iPad, I considered getting a slightly more capable one,
such as the iPad air, and using it as my main computing device, in essence
replacing my laptop. My conclusion from everything I read online at the time
though, was that the software ecosystem was simply not mature enough to do this.
Then, a few weeks after buying the iPad, my laptop broke down. It was not a
major issue, requiring at most a day work of repairs and maybe 200 NOK in parts,
but it was nevertheless annoying, and I had neither the time nor energy for the
repair at the time. I decided then that I would try and see if I could get away
with just the iPad.

I started looking around for apps. As I mentioned in the _old setup_ section, I
used my laptop as a university device. The iPad was already capable of running
all of the university software for assignments and communication, and I could
access the library and remote systems without problem. The main holdup however
was my writing setup. At this time, I was using LaTeX and vim. Luckily, by this
time, I had stopped modifying virtually all software I used, and focused on
portability by using standard and widely-available software. Nevertheless, I
still needed a LaTeX compiler and a text editor for my iPad, preferably git as
well, and preferably free (both as in freedom and gratis). I looked through the
AppStore and tried nearly every free LaTeX app. Most of them handed the
compilation off to a server, which was not suited for my purposes, and all of
the ones I tried had VERY barebone-editors, there was no good-, free- git app,
and really, I just wanted to go back to my comfortable tty.

It was while researching simply virtualising a Linux machine on the iPad that I
encountered an app called `a-shell'. Not a LaTeX compiler, but a unix shell for
iPad, which came with vim, git, and LaTeX. I said it in the previous post, and I
will say it again: This app is THE SOLE REASON I can use the iPad as a laptop
replacement.  Over half of my daily screen time is spent on this app alone, and
while it is clunky an limited, it is good enough for the work I need to do, that
being writing. If you are a programmer, you will not be able to live on iPad OS,
but if you are a writer comfortable with unix-like systems, then a-shell is the
place to go.

So that is the new setup. It embraces minimalism in the number of devices (I see
it as carrying around two multitools, rather than having a full toolbox), and it
embraces portability, because I can bring all my tech everywhere as long as I
have a small bag or cargo pants. As far as the whole `the device works for me'
thing, this is something which my perspective changed a lot on over the years.
Previously I wanted to control everything on my devices. I did not want a single
program to run without my knowledge and consent. This lead to much frustration
with virtually all devices except for those running Linux, or single-purpose
devices. Nowadays, I just let the device to whatever it wants as long as it does
not get in my way. I use the skills I gathered in the past to modify, and
manipulate my tech (especially the smartphone) to stay out of my way wherever
necessary, but I no-longer care enough to do a full sweep and really clamp the
device down.

That leaves us with the final principle: environmentalism. This is always a
difficult topic when talking about changing what devices you use. The primary
environmental problem with tech is e-waste, and I am contributing to the
problem. I try to minimize my impact by giving most of my old devices new homes,
and new purposes, but not many people are interested these days in a flipphone
from 2005, with a glued-on keyboard and a broken display. At the very least, I
used these devices to their limit, giving them use well after others had already
thrown them away.

But after reuse and reduce, there is only recycle left, and I know that much of
the rare-earth metals in electronic devices cannot be recycled. I hope to offset
my damage a bit by donating to wildlife conservation organisations such as Mossy
Earth (and I suggest you do the same), and other than that I will to keep my
current devices alive as long as possible. At least the smartphone and keyboard
were second-hand, though this seems a small drop in the bucket for the overall
e-waste problem. One day I will likely write about the right-to-repair movement,
and it impact on environmental concerns, but that day is not today.

If you have any questions or comments regarding my old-or-new setup, please send
me an email. The address is &blog@wester.digital&. I would be especially
interested in hearing your thoughts on breathing new life into my old devices,
especially the unstable android tablet, and the old Nokias.

Magic in fiction and real life
</title><pubDate>Wed, 6 Dec 2023</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<pre>
Fiction, Opinion
==============================

Magic is a large part of very form of fiction, and -- for me at least -- also a
large part of getting enjoyment out of everyday life. `Magic'  in this case
refers to a way of explaining certain phenomena in the world. Bad explanations
go along the lines of: ``its magic, now be quiet''. The other end contains
overly detailed explanations. Bordering on the edge of science, even if the
science is fictional. When magic is well done in a work of fiction, it always
fills me with the giddy sense of excitement. The explanations given dance just
at the border of what I can understand, and this sets my imagination going like
nothing else.

So then, let us look at some examples of magical systems in popular fiction,
explain why must of them are terrible at intriguing me, and follow all of this
up with some real world magic.

Harry Potter
------------

On of the most popular fictional works containing so-called magic is probably
Harry Potter. Love it or hate it, the Harry Potter franchise has been extremely
influential to fiction as a whole, and I can think of few people who have not
read at least one of the books, or seen a single movie.

That being said, the magic system in Harry Potter is terrible, truly amongst the
worst, here is why: How does magic work in the Harry Potter universe? You say a
spell, you flick a sick around, though sometimes you do not speak, and sometime
you do not flick, oh and you need to be born a wizard, which is a largely random
process. This system explains practically nothing, as most spell-based magical
systems do. Harry Potter goes the extra mile in lack-of-explanation by not even
explaining where the energy used to perform magics comes from.

Let me first address spellcasting more generally. Spellcasting, in its most
basic form is the utterance of a phrase. The main question that arises when you
implement a system like this is: Why that phrase? What is it about that
combination of sounds that causes the big magic to happen? Is someone or
something listening? If not, why must the sounds be vocalized at all?
Spellcasting can be implemented properly however, and the systems that do are
often among the most satisfying, but Harry Potter is not one of them.

Then there are wands and their movements. Magic, in Harry Potter, is seemingly
an inherent trait you are born with, that much is explained to us. We know that
wizards and witches can perform magic without a wand, though possession of a
proper wand allows for the focussing of energy like a lens. This much I can
accept, and I actually like about HP's system. I would still like to know where
the energy comes from, but this is certainly a start.

Thus wizards have or use energy through their wands, and making the right sounds
either kills a guy, or makes him grow a bear. By not explaining the spells at
all, there is very little room for the imagination to play. We know that
mispronouncing the levitation spell can cause you to spontaneously combust, but
there is not explanation as to why. Let us say we are speaking in a language
where float and explode sound very similar, then we might have some room to
fantasize. What if I used the hand motions of float, but instead I said boat,
would that summon an aeroplane? That sort of thing.

Avatar the last airbender
-------------------------

Let's look at a slightly better system: Avatar (the one with the tattooed monk,
not the blue aliens). In Avatar, it is presupposed that every person has some
sort of life force or energy flowing through them. Some people, called benders
know how to shape this life force in order to manipulate the elements: water
air, fire, and earth. This manipulation functions by moving one's body and the
energy within it, and we can see this in action both in the comics and the
television show. If a fire-bender moves their weight forward and thrusts an open
palm forwards, they might generate a large cloud of fire, whereas the same
movement with two outstretched fingers generates a finely concentrated stream of
fire, or even lightning.

This system works so well at its core because it uses fairly commonsensical
concepts and combines them in a way you can grasp, even though it is still
fictional. We know a thing or two about energy, we feel it when we become
excited or angry, we feel its absence when we are tired. We also know a thing or
two about manipulating the word through moving our limbs around. The fact that
Avatar borrows from Chinese folklore and martial arts only aids in our
understanding and the air of mystery surrounding it.

You can start to fantasise about certain motions combined with certain elements.
The story even encourages this as certain characters use the motions of
water bending with the energy of fire bending. You can envision your own moves
and variations, you can think of synergies and strategies, either borrowing from
martial arts, or simply letting your imagination run loose.

When it comes to explaining why only certain people can bend certain elements
however, the magic falls apart for me. In essence, it has something to do with
reincarnation and giant lion turtles who granted certain people the ability to
bend at some time in their past lives. But if the system is all about learning
to manipulate energy and moving your body, then why do we need to be imbued with
this gift? To me, some of the magic is lost in this explanation, as it makes
the whole bending idea much more otherworldly then it otherwise was.

Unsong
------

Now, let us turn to one of my favourite implementations of magic in all of
fiction: Unsong. In the world of Unsong, there are two forms of magic: names of
God, and placebomancy. In order to explain both of these, some background is
needed. The world of Unsong adheres to the biblical story of creation for the
most part. However, after a war between the hosts of heaven and the hosts of
hell, one angel: Uriel, decided to reprogram the world into the probabilistic
system of atoms and forces we know today. Before this time, everything in
existence was a direct expression of God's numerous faculties. After the
restructuring of reality, history progresses as we know it, up until the space
race. During one of the Apollo missions, humans attempt to orbit the moon and
end up crashing into the crystal sphere that surrounds the earth. This sphere
kept out the divine light and kept the world functioning probabilistically and
all that.

With the sphere cracked, a tiny amount to divine light is let back in. This
means that everything in existence is now a little more an expression of God
than it was before. Words previously just expressed things in existence, but now
they also express God. The things in existence these words used to refer to also
express God, and so there is not a connection between the thing and its
expression, between the map and the territory. These two influence each other in
both directions. Founding a town will cause it to be put on a map, but putting a
town on a map may just as well cause people to settle there.

In the world of Unsong, that certain phrases express God's faculties more
clearly than others. These are the names of God, and they have various effects,
such as making you bulletproof, walk on water, or become invisible. They do so
by clearly expressing God's indestructible nature, His weightless, His
obscurity, etcetera. A name of God is an expression of ultimate reality, and an
expression of reality is no different from reality itself.  However, this is --
by far -- the less interesting system of the two form of magic in Unsong.

The second system is called placebomancy and it neatly encapsulates all forms of
magic. Spells? got those, potions? got those, Avatar-esque bending? yes sir.  A
placebomancer attempts to convince reality that a certain thing ought to happen.
Placebomancers use the entire narrative for their acts, carrying a mystique,
having mysterious backstories, and ensuring esoteric places to perform their
rituals. The reason this works is that, since the sky cracked, reality is not as
stable as it used to be, and if you can convince it somehow that what you are
doing ought to make fire shoot from your fingers, then that is what will happen.
The stories we tell each other are a part of reality, therefore: wearing a robe
and waving a wand helps to convince reality that you are doing magic.

What is great about this system is that it simply uses a facet of the
fundamental functioning of Unsong's world: the way we express things is just as
real as those things themselves. Furthermore, it is inherently limited, which
explains nicely why everyone is not just placebomancing their way into paradise
on earth. Sure you MIGHT be able to convince reality that the devil never
existed, but the devil very strongly believes that he does, and so do many
others. Then again, if you can find a convincing narrative, the world lies at
your feet.

Both of these systems are things you can grasp, but not quite fully comprehend,
thus leaving space for your imagination to fill in the blanks. This is the real
magic at play here. No words on a page can make magic to the same extent your
own imagination can. Thus, let us finally move on to real magic.

Magic in the real world
-----------------------

With real-word magic, I do not mean spells of ice and fire, nor ritual magic or
elemental bending. I simply refer to those things which have a magical air about
them. Things which we can understand just well enough for them to instill a
childlike wonder in us and set our imaginations working. These things excite and
intrigue us. Too-simple and they are not magical at all, too complicated, and it
is science.

Let's start with a personal example: audio cassettes. Audio cassettes work by
putting air vibrations onto magnetic tape and retrieving them in the reverse
manner. Now: I understand air vibrations, when listening to music (especially
loud music) I can feel the speaker and the ground shake, I understand that this
is the essence of sound. I also understand magnets. That is not to say that I
necessarily grasp magnetic fields and such, but I know how magnets work, I have
seen and felt them work. Expressing the vibrations of air linearly as thousands
of little magnets on a tape, and spinning that tape to get the vibrations back
is the essence of an audio cassette. The fact that we can do this is absolutely
incredible to me, and, though I fully understand the parts, I still find it
amazing that we can bend reality in this manner. In short, it is magical to me.

Staying on the topic of audio: I do not find digital music players magical in
the slightest. I simply do not grasp flash-storage, digital-to-analogue
converters, and transistors well enough. These are all elements squarely in the
realm of science. You would not try to explain them to a child, and with an adult
you would use complex theories, and a lot a math. This is neither exciting nor
intriguing. Sure it is impressive, but impressive and magical are two entirely
different things.

There are also systems which are too-simple to be magical. I find nothing
magical about a classic gas-stove. Propane moves from the tank to the stove, it
it seeps out slowly and constantly ignites itself. It is too-simple. Induction
stoves on the other hand are too complicated. This also shows how subjective
this magical feeling can be. To you, maybe a propane torch is magical, or maybe
you grew up with so much magnetic field theory that induction stoves occupy the
same space for you as cassette tapes do for me. 

I honestly believe that keeping some of this magic in your life is a large part
of being happy and curious about the world. These `magical' things are the first
places where you can learn more. You can turn your basic grasp into full
understanding, at which point new magics open up to you. If you had to start
your journey into electronic by understanding  modern chip architecture, I am
almost certain your search would never lead anywhere, it would simply be
too-overwhelming. For me, magic can be found in audio cassettes, chemical
photography, fermentation, pregnancies, seed germination, and so much more. For
you the list might be different, but I think the effect is the same.  Fiction is
one way of keeping magic in your life at least. And if it is done well, it can
instill a sense of wonder for the world as a whole, not just for the fictional
universe where the magic originated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will close with one recommendation for a work of fiction, that being ``The
name of the Wind'' by Patrick Rothfuss. It is the first book of a as-of-yet
unfinished trilogy. And I enjoyed reading it very much. It has a great an
innovative system of magic, which spiked my curiosity many time throughout the
book, and the general storyline is very engaging. Above all though, it has been
a while since a book managed to arouse my emotions so well. There were times I
got so upset and angry at the main-character's actions that I had to put the
book down for a few days to read a different novel. There were many many times
where I had to stifle a fit of giggling in the library or on public transport.
And I even smiled on occasion, which is not particularly something I am known to
do. 

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to send me an email at
&blog@wester.digital&, I am especially interested in your thoughts about
real-world-magic, as well as any book recommendations you might have, especially
is they are works containing ~good~ magical systems.
